# SiTTeRS - Simple Table Top Rule Set


This is a board and rule set for a simple table top role playing game that I've started developing to play against my daughter. It should be quite well suited to beginners and young children.

I've developed and released some simple computer games in the past, but never a traditional table top or pen and paper game. My table top gaming career so far has been pretty much limited to Monopoly and Scrabble, I've never played anything like Dungeons & Dragons, Magic The Gathering, Settlers of Cataan, etc. Please temper your expectations accordingly!

I've played this game a few times against my (almost) six year old daughter. Each game lasted between 15 and 30 minutes each. She always plays as the goodies, and so far the (admittedly quite forgiving) baddies have failed to win a single game.

It can easily be expanded to team play where a team of siblings/friends collaborate on decisions and control the "goodies" as a team. Other group play options might be to take rounds in turn, or even each control their own specific markers, lots of possibilities to experiment with...

This game could be packaged as a simple single player computer game with basic AI controlling the baddies (I'm thinking a web browser game, or mobile app, or maybe a retro spectrum or game boy ROM!). It could also form a sub module in a larger game (see strategic combat in Gurk, or triple triad in FF8, etc).

The tabletop game itself could be expanded such that the survivors go on to delve into a fresh board... A single game could last for hours or days or weeks. I personally prefer to limit it to short self contained sessions!

## PLAYING PIECES

* 1 x Game board (We drew the board on a sheet of A3 - 4cm square spaces)
* 1 x D6 (We borrowed from a junior monopoly set - standard die)
* 4 x "Goodie" markers (We borrowed from a junior monopoly set - player pieces)
* 6 x "Baddie" markers (We used some small my little pony figurines)
* 8 x "Chest" markers (We borrowed from a standard monopoly set - hotel pieces)
* 1 x Pen or pencil
* 1 x Piece of paper

  
## SETUP

* Decide which player will control of the goodies and which will control the baddies...
* The goodie player places the goodie markers on any "G" spaces of their choice (maximum one marker per space)
* The baddie player places the baddie markers on the "B" spaces (one marker in each space)
* The goodie player places four chest markers on any "C" spaces of their choice (maximum one marker per space)
* The baddie player places four chest markers on any "C" spaces of their choice (maximum one marker per space)

Note the goodie/baddie roles can be somewhat subjective (or even completely flipped) depending on the narrative...
So far we have played using traditional RPG roles - a party of courageous dungeon delvers (good) looting chests and being attacked by monsters (bad)...
It could just as easily be space pirates stealing from a space station and being attacked by sentry bots, or burglars looting houses and being opposed by police officers, etc...
For simplicity's sake I'll stick to black and white definitions of good and bad when defining the rules.


##   OBJECTIVES

Goodie: Guide as many good markers as possible to the safe zone, collecting as much gold as possible along the way.
Baddie: Defeat the goodies before they reach the safe zone, and try to stop them from collecting any gold.

  
## SCORING NOTES

* Score is only calculated when the game ends (no goodie markers left on board - all are either dead or made it to the safe zone).
* If score >4, goodies win. If score <4, baddies win. If score =4, draw game.
* The game can still result in a draw even if all goodie pieces reach the safe zone (very little gold collected), or if lots of gold is collected (and none or few goodie pieces reach the safe zone).

## RULES OF PLAY

* A round consists of two goodie turns followed by a single baddie turn.
* Rounds keep being played repeatedly until the game is over (no goodie markers left on board - all are either dead or made it to the safe zone).
* On each turn the player rolls the die, and moves one of their active board markers that number of spaces.
* Markers can only move in up/down/left/right directions (no diagonal movements).
* If a marker lands on an occupied space (either occupied by an opponent or chest marker) it must stop at that space (no passing) and the turn ends.
* Baddie markers are not allowed to enter spaces occupied by a chest marker.
* Where a goodie marker occupies the same space as a chest marker, the goodie player must roll again - the (empty) chest marker is removed from the board and the die face value is added to their gold tally.
* Where a goodie marker occupies the same space as a baddie marker, both players must roll again to battle - highest value wins (re-roll on draw) and the losing (dead) marker is removed from the board.
* Goodie markers that reach the safe zone are removed from the board and added to the survivors tally - they cannot under any circumstances return to the game board.
* Anytime (other than during battle) a 6 is rolled, the player can opt to forfeit their move/gold and return one of their defeated markers back onto the board (place on any free starting space - "G" for goodie or "B" for a baddie)
